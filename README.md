# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
 
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of creating a design,testing and maintaining software.
importance of Software engineering in the industry, help to enhance efficiency in orgrganisations, ensuresure data security and companies in the industry can be able to secure there data, another benefit is it enables companies advance semlesly and can be able to transfer data from difrent parts of the world.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software enginering stratted in the early 1968 and in the year 1990s codding with laguages was officialy launched, and from the early 2000s the revolution began.  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Plannig planing the goal, 
Analysis gathering documents the user need.
Design,Creating the structure, UI/UX
Implementation, Scripting the whole code
Testing, Test drive, beofre launching or deploying.
Deployment, Launch/ Publish for use,
Maintainance,Update,fix buggs and improve the code

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. 

Waterfal is rigid for fixed projects in the banking systems the steps and phases must be copleted beofre moving to the next phase. , 
Agile is flexible for mobile applications and startups,


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
